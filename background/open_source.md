###[TinyDDS](https://code.google.com/p/tinydds/)

Taken from https://code.google.com/p/tinydds/:

>TinyDDS is an open-source and standards-based publish/subscribe middleware for wireless sensor networks. Compliant with the Object Management Group (OMG)â€™s Data Distribution Service (DDS) specification, TinyDDS is designed and implemented generic enough to aid in developing a wide range of event detection and data collection applications.

>TinyDDS is currently implemented in nesC, a dialect of the C language, for the TinyOS platform as well as in Java for the SunSPOT platform.


###[Tinq](https://github.com/vmayoral/tinq-core)

Tinq (branch of Qeo) includes an open source DDS implementation writen in plain C and licensed as Clear BSD. Although it was coded for general purpose OSs, the code interfaces are nicely separated which might allow to easily port it to embedded platforms.
