nanoDDS
===============

[nanoDDS](https://github.com/vmayoral/nanoDDS) is an _Open Source_ Data Distribution Service (DDS) for embedded devices implemented _from scratch_ to provide an open alternative in the embedded world for ROS 2, the next generation of the Robot Operative System framework.
Refer to [this repository](https://github.com/vmayoral/nanoDDS) for the code.

[Chapter 1: Background](background/README.md) provides a background research and comparison betweem different embedded DDSs. [Chapter 2: DDS](dds/README.md) will describe and document the implementation of nanoDDS. [Chapter 3: Using nanoDDS](using_nanodds/README.md) will show how to use nanoDDS through a set of tutorials and examples.

This work has been performed at the [Open Source Robotics Foundation, Inc.](http://osrfoundation.org/).
