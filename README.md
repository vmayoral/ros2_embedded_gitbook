nanoDDS
===============

[nanoDDS](https://github.com/vmayoral/nanoDDS) is an _Open Source_ Data Distribution Service (DDS) for embedded devices implemented _from scratch_ to provide an open alternative in the embedded world for ROS 2, the next generation of the Robot Operative System framework.

This work will be performed at the [Open Source Robotics Foundation, Inc.](http://osrfoundation.org/).
